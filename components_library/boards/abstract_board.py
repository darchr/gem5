    Boards are used as the object which can connect together all other system

    boards must provide. Boards can be specialized for different ISAs or system
    designs (e.g., core counts, cache types, memory channels, I/O devices, etc)

    In addition to providing the place that system components are connected,
    the board also exposes an interface for the caches, processor, and memory
    to interact.

    The board also exposes an interface to set up I/O devices which needs to be
    specialized for each ISA and/or platform.
