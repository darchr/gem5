This configuation script shows an example of how to restore a checkpoint that
was taken for SimPoints in the 
configs/example/gem5_library/checkpoints/simpoints-se-checkpoint.py.
The SimPoints, SimPoints interval length, and the warmup instruction length 
are passed into the SimPoint module, so the SimPoint object will store and 
calculate the warmup instruction length for each SimPoints based on the 
avaliable instructions before reaching the start of the SimPoint. With the 
Simulator module, exit event will be generated to stop when the warmup session
ends and the SimPoints interval ends. 

This scipt builds a more complex board than the board used for taking 
checkpoint.
