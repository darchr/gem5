        Need to pass in the paths or the lists for the SimPoints and their
        weights. If the paths are passed in, no actions will be done to the
        list.

        When passing in simpoint_list and weight_list, passing in sorted lists
        (sorted by SimPoints in ascending order) is strongly suggested.
        The warmup_list only works correctly with sorted simpoint_list.
